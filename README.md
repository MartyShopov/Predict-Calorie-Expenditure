## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the **Predict Calorie Expenditure** competition on Kaggle's 2025 Playground Series.  
The challenge involves predicting the number of calories burned during a workout based on a tabular dataset.

The goal of the competition is to build a regression model that accurately estimates calorie expenditure, evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).
